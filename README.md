Staff to make the analysis of the NYC database

This repository will stor my code and data to do the analysis of the dataset. 

The original dataset has mons than 170 millions of lines, by using a PostgreSQL DataBase, I generate a ramdom sample, size 1%, of the original dataset. Although this sampa, even zipped, is to big to be stored Here. I uploaded the .rar file in my OneDrive (https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajm2LzwZnxRD4XGQxnH6MuBsn_yL)

Part of the code is original from https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoftrservertigerteam/2017/01/17/predicting-nyc-taxi-tips-using-microsoftml/.

The objective of this analysis is to study the functions of the MicrosoftML R's Package.
